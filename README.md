# Itu-bsc-2026-sqlVisualizer

## What does this project do?
This project visualizes SQL to help students break up complex qurries into smaller parts.

## Why is this project useful?
When SQL querries become large and complex it can be difficult to even get started.
We have analysed exam results from the database course at IT university at Copenhagen 2025 which shows a drop in how many students attempt to answer the SQL questions from 201 to 81 tries.

## How do I get started?
Currently you can clone the project and run it localy with an IDEA suited for .NET projects
